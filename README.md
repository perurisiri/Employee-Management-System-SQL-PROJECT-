👨‍💼 Employee Management System

📖 Introduction

The Employee Management System (EMS) is a SQL-based database project designed to efficiently manage an organization’s employee information, including personal details, job roles, departments, payroll, leaves, and qualifications.
This project demonstrates the use of relational databases and SQL queries to maintain, retrieve, and analyze HR-related data.

It aims to:

Optimize HR workflows

Improve data accuracy and consistency

Enable fast insights into employee performance, payroll trends, and departmental efficiency

🎯 Project Objective

To design and implement an Employee Management System that:

Stores and manages employee-related data in normalized relational tables

Uses primary and foreign key relationships for data integrity

Simplifies the management of payroll, leaves, and job information

Enables complex querying for analytics and business intelligence

🧩 Database Structure
Tables Used

Employee – Stores employee details (ID, name, job, department, etc.)

JobDepartment – Contains job roles and department information

Leaves – Tracks employee leaves

Payroll – Manages payroll information for each employee

Salary_Bonus – Records employee salaries and bonuses

Qualification – Lists employee qualifications

🧠 Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram

The ER diagram defines relationships between:

Employees and their Departments, Qualifications, and Payrolls

Job roles linked to Salary and Bonus

Leaves associated with Employee IDs

This relational structure allows efficient tracking of employee and department-level performance.
